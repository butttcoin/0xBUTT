## Test cases

These are the tes-cases performed on the 0xBUTT.

Most of the test-cases cannot be done real-time and the code had to be adjusted so that certain statements are executed.  For example, instead of waiting 3 years for a difficulty reset, we are waiting a few minutes only.

Furthermore, most of the test-cases are manual and by the observation only.
