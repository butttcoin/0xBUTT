## Test cases

These are the test-cases performed on the 0xBUTT.

If the text-format looks messed-up just click on the readme.md file in a directory then on the raw view. 

Some of the important test-cases cannot be done real-time and the code had to be adjusted so that certain statements are executed.  For example, instead of waiting 3 years for a difficulty reset, we are waiting a few minutes only.

Furthermore, most of the test-cases are manual and by the observation only.
